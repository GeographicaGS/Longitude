# Longitude SAMPLE scripts

In this folder you will find examples about how to use the features in the library.

Please, keep in mind that these will be not so updated as the ```tests```. You should rely on the ```tests``` tp fully understand how the library works.

Please, if you find any wrong example or something to improve, submit a PR :)
